# Coursera-Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

###The purpose of this project was to demonstrate our ability to collect, work with, and clean data.  

###The data utilized for this project came from accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

###A full description is available at the following site: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

###The data used for this project can be found by downloading the zip file through this link: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

###Once the data has been downloaded and the working directory in R has been set to where the data is located, the R Script run_analysis.R can be utilized to create a Tidy_Dataset which contains the mean values by participant and activity for each of the mean and standard deviation variables provided within the downloaded data.

###The codebook located within the repository gives a brief walkthrough of how the script works as well as a list of variable names.
